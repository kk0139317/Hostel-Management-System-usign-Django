Hostel Management System
The Hostel Management System is a web application built using Django, a Python-based framework. It offers a comprehensive solution for efficient management of staff and residents in a hostel environment. The project utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the front-end interface, while the back-end functionality is handled by Django. The SQLite-3 database is employed to store and manage data effectively.
